#### This plugin is deprecated and will no longer be supported.

Instead /configure your DotCi build project to use Build Type: [Docker Compose Build](https://github.com/groupon/DotCi/tree/master/src/main/java/com/groupon/jenkins/buildtype/dockercompose).
This docker compose build type has its own custom [.ci.yml reference](http://groupon.github.io/DotCi/user-guide/DockerCompose).

The old Install Package build type as of [DotCi-2.13.0](https://github.com/groupon/DotCi/commits/DotCi-2.13.0) has been moved to https://github.com/DotCi/DotCi-InstallPackages.
